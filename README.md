This project may eventually integrate modern capabilities into Oberon, a classic
operating system and language.

To run the risc v5 emulator (REM) you can download the binary for your platform or you can compile from source.

# Emulated - Binary
* Download the <a href="https://github.com/io-core/io/raw/master/rem/rem.amd64">Linux REM binary</a>, <a href="https://github.com/io-core/io/raw/master/rem/rem.darwin">Mac REM binary</a>, or Windows REM binary
* Make the binary exeutable (e.g. chmod 755 rem.amd64 or chmod 755 rem.darwin)
* Download the <a href="https://github.com/io-core/io/raw/master/rem/Oberon-2016-08-02.dsk">RISC os disc image</a>
