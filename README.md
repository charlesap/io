Integrated Oberon
=================
 
<img align="right" src="https://github.com/charlesap/io/blob/main/images/cowhead.png"> Integrated Oberon builds on the RISC Oberon reboot of the classic operating system and language.
<hr>

The project [documentation](https://github.com/io-core/doc) describes Integrated Oberon in more depth, includes how to get it and how to use it, and contains the "odoc" automatically generated documentation produced from the source code.

Additional information about the project and its goals can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/io-core/io/wiki">io project wiki</a>

Issues with the Integrated Oberon project in general are tracked [here](https://github.com/io-core/io/issues) while there are separate trackers for the following sub-projects: [doc](https://github.com/io-core/doc/issues) [Kernel](https://github.com/io-core/Kernel/issues) [Files](https://github.com/io-core/Files/issues) [Modules](https://github.com/io-core/Modules/issues) [Edit](https://github.com/io-core/Edit/issues) [Oberon](https://github.com/io-core/Oberon/issues) [System](https://github.com/io-core/System/issues) [Build](https://github.com/io-core/Build/issues) [Draw](https://github.com/io-core/Draw/issues)

This project may eventually integrate modern capabilities into Oberon, a classic
operating system and language.
