Integrated Oberon
=================

<img src="https://github.com/charlesap/io/blob/master/cowhead.png">

This project may eventually integrate modern capabilities into Oberon, a classic
operating system and language.

Meanwhile, in oberon-risc-ethz you will find patches to Peter De Wachter's 
Oberon Risc Emulator and changes to Display.Mod and Input.Mod to support large screens
in emulation (as shown in the above screenshot.)

You will also find Linker.Mod, which allows OberonV5 (2013) to compile its own boot 
track from source code to a binary file, making the
system almost self-hosted. An additional tool (such as 'dd' on the host) is 
required to install the boot
track.
